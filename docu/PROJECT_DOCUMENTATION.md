**Purpose:** Provide dynamic, stem-based soundtrack for LAN party chaos  

**Technical Specifications:**

**Escalation logic:**
- Normal â†’ Layer 1+2
- Chaos 50% â†’ +Drums
- Chaos 75% â†’ +Lead guitar
- Boss â†’ All layers + distortion
- Wipe â†’ Game Over jingle

### 3.3 Track List

Retro 8-bit chiptune arpeggio intro, layered with thrash metal guitars and heavy drums. Style: NES soundtrack meets Metallica. Uplifting but chaotic arcade vibe.
```

Full thrash metal meltdown fused with chiptune leads, double kick drums, distorted guitars, chaotic glitch FX. BPM 190. Intense, wild, overwhelming arcade chaos.
```

#### Last Survivor Theme
```
Minimal 8-bit pulse wave baseline, slow build tension, gradually layering distorted guitar harmonics. Dark, suspenseful, last stand energy.
```

#### Boss Wave Theme

Epic 8-bit chiptune meets brutal thrash metal. Glitchy synth sweeps, double pedal drums, crushing riffs, retro arpeggios screaming. BPM 200. Feels like final level meltdown.
```

Happy NES-style 8-bit melody (5 seconds) that abruptly distorts into a screaming metal guitar drop.
```

Triumphant retro arpeggio in major key layered with epic thrash metal guitar solo. Energetic and celebratory, arcade high-score vibe.
```
